[00:17.26] I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
[00:20.62] How we met and the sparks flew instantly
[00:24.39] People would say, "They're the lucky ones"
[00:31.17] I used to know my place was a spot next to you
[00:34.49] Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
[00:37.72] 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
[01:03.22] 
[00:45.00] Oh, a simple complication
[00:47.12] Miscommunications lead to fallout
[00:51.29] So many things that I wish you knew
[00:54.67] So many walls up, I can't break through
[01:14.17] 
[00:58.73] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
[01:02.14] And we're not speaking
[01:06.15] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
[01:09.00] Like it's killing me, yeah
[01:12.82] I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
[01:15.95] When it all broke down
[01:18.40] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[01:24.75] Next chapter
[01:30.75] 
[01:32.52] How'd we end up this way?
[01:34.77] See me nervously pulling at my clothes
[01:38.02] And trying to look busy
[01:39.84] And you're doing your best to avoid me
[01:45.92] I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
[01:49.63] How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
[01:53.22] But you held your pride like you should have held me
[02:19.22] 
[01:59.64] Oh I'm scared to see the ending
[02:02.28] Why are we pretending this is nothing?
[02:06.61] I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
[02:10.28] I've never heard silence quite this loud
[02:30.28] 
[02:13.98] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
[02:17.26] And we're not speaking
[02:20.75] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
[02:24.09] Like it's killing me
[02:27.44] I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
[02:31.02] When it all broke down
[02:33.80] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[02:58.80] 
[02:54.65] This is looking like a contest
[02:58.32] Of who can act like they care less
[03:01.22] But I liked it better when you were on my side
[03:08.64] The battle's in your hands now
[03:12.28] But I would lay my armor down
[03:15.15] If you'd say you'd rather love then fight
[03:21.99] So many things that you wish I knew
[03:25.24] But the story of us might be ending soon
[03:45.24] 
[03:28.95] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
[03:33.09] And we're not speaking
[03:36.29] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
[03:40.05] Like it's killing me, yeah
[03:42.75] I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
[03:46.52] When it all broke down
[03:49.13] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[03:53.07] Now, now
[03:57.07] 
[04:00.06] And we're not speaking
[04:03.65] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
[04:06.91] Like it's killing me? yeah
[04:10.06] And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
[04:13.60] 'Cause we're going down
[04:16.59] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[04:22.77] The end
